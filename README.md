# Collision Detection and Response for 2D Objects

Welcome to the demo showcasing collision detection and response for 2D objects using the Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) algorithm in a Windows environment. This project not only performs collision checks between two objects but also provides visual representation and diagnostics to better understand the underlying mechanisms.

## üåü Features:

1. **Separating Axis Theorem (SAT)**: Reliable method to check if two convex polygons are intersecting.
2. **Dynamic Frame Buffer Management**: Reallocates the buffer memory as the window size changes, ensuring the application remains adaptive and responsive.
3. **Intuitive Input Handling**: Use your mouse and keyboard to interact with and move the objects.
4. **FPS & Duration Diagnostics**: Real-time FPS and frame duration display for performance checks.
5. **Font Loading**: Load custom fonts from directories for on-screen text.
6. **Concave & Convex Hull Generation**: Convert object shapes to their concave and convex representations.

## üöÄ Getting Started:

1. **Run the Program**:
   - Clone this repository.
   - Run the executable file with the dependancies which are all in the same folder as the .exe file.

3. **Editing the Code**:
   - Edit the codeby opening the solution file on Microsoft Visual Studio (Not VS code!).

4. **Observations**:
   - Notice the real-time collision detection and response between the objects.
   - The FPS and frame duration details will be displayed on the screen.

## üìå Future Improvements:

- **Audio Integration**: With the provided placeholder for the `winmm.lib`, you can easily integrate sound effects or background music to enhance the experience.
- **More Complex Shapes**: Extend the functionality to support more complex shapes and multiple objects.
- **Enhanced Physics**: Implement momentum, restitution, and friction for more realistic interactions.
